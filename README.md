# Final Assignment 1: Regularization Parameter Analysis

## Overview
In this assignment, we explore the effects of varying the regularization parameter on different performance measures and implemented in `my_measures.py`. The focus is on the `alpha` parameter of the `RidgeClassifier()` class.

## Objectives
- Understand the impact of regularization on model performance.
- Experiment with different values of the `alpha` parameter and observe their effects on performance measures.
